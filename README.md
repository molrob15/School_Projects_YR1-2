# School_Projects_YR1-2
School projects from first and second year. 

C applications are written with Gedit in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, and are they are executed from the command line.

 - The first assignment reads a list of names from a file and uses a simple sorting algorithm to sort the names in right order.
 - In the second assignment the application prints out ascii art in the terminal, doesn't work perfectly, needs some tweaking.
 - The third assignment is the game Othello, in which two players can play a game in the terminal window.


In Embedded Systems have I used the Arduino IDE for Arduino UNO projects.

But for the final project, my weatherstation I used the Particle Build IDE and a Particle Photon as microcontroller.
 - Assignment1 is a 8x8 LED Matrix that prints a line of text (characters) which the user types in the code. 
 - Assignment2 is an Alarm Clock using a RTC clock and a TFT screen. 
 - Assignment3 is a weather station using four different sensors, and displays data readings on a mobile device using Blynk. 


Mobile Development - Android Studio IDE was used as coding environment.

 - The first application is the game TicTacToe
 - The second application is an hotel and hospitality app
